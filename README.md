# Retagger
Retagger removes and adds the same tags for all files and folders within a directory so that they can appear in the tags section in finder


The Retagger app will untag each file and folder and retag it with the same tags. This way the retagged files and folders will show up under the tag categories in the Finder sidebar. Selecting a folder will force all nested folders and files under that Folder to be retagged.
